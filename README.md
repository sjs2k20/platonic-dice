# Platonic Dice  

**Platonic Dice** is a JavaScript library designed for developers and TTRPG enthusiasts who need an accurate and flexible dice-rolling system. It simulates rolling all six classic TTRPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) with persistent die instances for tracking roll history.  

### Features  
- **Realistic Dice Simulation** – Generates rolls that mimic physical dice.  
- **Persistent Die Instances** – Track roll history per die.  
- **Developer-Friendly API** – Easily integrate dice mechanics into applications.  
- **TTRPG Rule Support** – Simplifies dice-related logic in game development.  
- **Modular & Extensible** – Use it as a standalone tool or import it as a library.  

### Current Status  
This project is a **work in progress**, with core functionality in place and additional features in development. Future updates will include improved API design, expanded roll tracking, and enhanced integration options.  

### Future Aims  
- ~~Implement **custom roll modifiers** (e.g., advantage, rerolls).~~ 
- ~~Add **multidice rolling** and result analysis.~~ 
- Improve **roll history tracking** with timestamps and statistics.  
- Provide an **optional UI component** for visualization.
